Luhm Algorithm with visual aid.

It is a simple project where you can see my implementation of the credit / debit card
validation known as Luhm Algorithm. You also can generate some card numbers to use them
for test cases. I made a simple SWING GUI (with the NetBeans designer) to make it more 
easy to test.
